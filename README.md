## Which Plan Should You Get?

Look, there's no "best" plan—just what works for your situation. Here's the breakdown:

### Los Angeles CN2 GIA-E – The Daily Driver

This is the workhorse. The DC6 CN2 GIA datacenter offers solid performance without the premium price tag. You can switch between multiple datacenters (DC6, DC9, Netherlands 9929) if you need different routing options.

Good for: General use, small to medium traffic sites, development servers

Curious about whether CN2 GIA routing actually makes a difference for your location? The performance gap between standard and premium routing can be substantial, especially during peak hours. 👉 [See how BandwagonHost's CN2 GIA network handles real-world traffic conditions](https://bandwagonhost.com/aff.php?aff=79616)

### Hong Kong CN2 GIA – When Budget Isn't the Issue

MEGA2 datacenter in Hong Kong. Supports China Telecom CN2 GIA, China Unicom, and China Mobile direct connections. Lower latency to Asian regions, but you're paying for that proximity.

Good for: Businesses targeting Asian markets, users who need minimal latency to mainland China

### Tokyo CN2 GIA – The Sweet Spot for Many

Equinix TY8 datacenter. Similar routing quality to Hong Kong but often with better availability. Supports CN2 GIA, Unicom 9929, and Mobile CMI routes.

Good for: Asian traffic with Japanese server preference, balanced performance and cost
